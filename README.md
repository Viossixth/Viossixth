## Hi there 👋

My tech journey started young, in Grade 4 to be exact. Doing homework on MicroSoft Word, navigating the early internet, fascinated by how technology connected information. I've always been fascinated and curious about whats possible on the internet. I've watched tech evolve from Blackberries to smartphones, from data dongles to fiber internet. I hope to bring my curiosity and experience into the tech space.

## What I'm building towards

Aspiring Junior Cloud / Infrastructure Engineer with AWS re/Start certification and hands-on experience deploying and managing cloud infrastructure on AWS. Strong foundation in Linux, networking, and system reliability, with an engineering mindset from Civil Engineering training. Seeking an entry-level cloud or DevOps role to support scalable, reliable systems.

## AWS re/Start Journey

**Background**

Currently I am a Civil Engineering student with Unisa. Engineering has shaped me to focus on the small details, to actively work as a collective and see the bigger picture when a problem arises. It's the communication, people skills and problem solving skills that have been sharpened through my academic experience.
