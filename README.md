## Hi there 👋

My tech journey started young Grade 4, to be exact. Researching unique geological formations on MS Word, navigating the early internet, fascinated by how technology connected information. That curiosity never left. I've watched tech evolve from Blackberries to smartphones, from data dongles to fiber internet. Now I'm not just watching I'm building, securing, and learning how to architect the cloud infrastructure that powers tomorrow.

## What I'm building towards

I'm on a mission to enter the Cloud Security domain, combining infrastructure knowledge with security best practices to help organizations build resilient systems.
Aspiring Cloud Professional focused implementing best practices across AWS environments. I believe technology isn't just about innovation,it's about securing that innovation. That's where I want to be. Dedicated. Hungry. Disciplined. I know dreams are a matter of time, and with patience and persistence, goals become reality.

## AWS re/Start Journey

**Background**

Currently I am a Civil Engineering student with Unisa, but through curiosity I wanted to delve into tech. Engineering has shaped me to focus on the small details, to actively work as a collective and see the bigger picture when a problem arises. It's the communication, people skills and problem solving skills I want to bring over to my new path.
